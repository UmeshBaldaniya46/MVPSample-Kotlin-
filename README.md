# MVPSample-Kotlin-
android-mvp-architecture

A sample project of Android MVP architecture.

Libraries

In this sample project includes some of useful libraries for Android, such as:

Retrofit: A type-safe REST client for Android which intelligently maps an API into a client interface using annotations.
ButterKnife: Using Java annotations, makes Android development better by simplifying common tasks.
Eventbus: Event bus for Android and Java that simplifies communication between Activities, Fragments, Threads, Services, etc. Less code, better quality
[Lonstraint Layout]: A beautiful, allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).
Before we go through to learn this architecture, I hope you've understand about the Clean Architecture
